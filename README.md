# btsource re-launch!

My portfolio web site source code. Style guide and docs coming soon.
Planned launch dates:
* 6/30/2015 - Update dead line

I've been uploading acceptable changes once a day when I find changes appropriate for production grade. This usually includes major functionality fixes, typos, and perofmance imporvements.

# Current TODO:
1. Clean up CSS files
2. Simplify Color usage
3. Fix SVG splash image
3. Edit style guide to match new CSS rules
4. Split about section into 4 logical categories:
  * Code - A blurb about my ambitions and accomplishments as a programmer/software engineer.
  * Math - A blurb about my ambitions and accomplishments as a mathematician.
  * Design - A blurb about my ambitions and accomplishments as a designer.

# An Open Source Repo:
Use these files as you wish. Open Source for life.

## Feedback, Contacts, and Work:

Feel free to contact me with feedback regarding the code/design of the site. I am also looking for work in front-end, and UI design, and general collaboration.
