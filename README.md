My portfolio web site source code. Style guide and docs coming soon.
Planned launch dates:
* 07/4/2015 (main portfolio page)

* 15/4/2015 (main pjoects pages)


# Pre-Launch TODO:

1. Create consistent navigation in header.
2. Complete splash image
3. Deisgn, and implement 'Project' pages
 * Design logos
 * Refine layout
5. Implement 'Donate' section
6. Revise bio spelling/grammar
7. Finish implementing the style guide
8. Implement 3 default buttons (rgb, s,m,l)

## 'Workspace' folder:

The workspace folder is intended to be a safe place where I can implement new components into the site. My prototyping space was initally located out side of the btsource directory. Having this folder will allow me to have quick access to components I want ti implement into the main site.

## Current http://www.btsource.net/ boilerplate site:

The ugly muse boilerplate in place right now is going away soon. I update this git repo frequently to show that progress is being made towards a better portfolio and projects website for my freelance ambitions, and Computer Science studies.

## Feedback, Contacts, and Work:

Feel free to contact me with feedback regarding the code/design of the site. I am also looking for work in front-end, and UI design, and general collaboration.
