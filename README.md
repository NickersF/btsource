# BTSOURCE.net - Source Code Repository

### http://www.btsource.net/

Take a look around and check out the code. Currently on stable version 1.5.0. Check this page to
see what changes and additions are taking place at [btsource.net] (http://www.btsource.net). The committ and upload
schedule falls in line with my school schedule. During college breaks the repo and web site will be 
more active. I do my best to keep a bi-monthly update schedule during school sessions and address major
bugs and fixes.
